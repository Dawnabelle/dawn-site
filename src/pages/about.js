          It's so weird, so feared, yet wonderful to see<br/>

          <h5>He's just a thumb</h5>
          <p>At the height of my depression, I found the most amazing puppy on the planet. He saved my life and made me a better person. I hope he understands what he means to me. When this photo was taken, he was nameless.</p>

          <h2>The Great Outdoors</h2>
          <h3>Fresh air, free mind.</h3>
          <p>I've always loved being outside! In Florida, the beach was my escape. In NYC, it was Prospect Park. In Atlanta, it was Piedmont Park. Now that I'm in Oregon, I explore the Pacific Northwest as often as I possibly can. Always, with Mustard.</p>
